       polygon clipping functions. harry eaton implemented the algorithm
       described in "A Closed Set of Algorithms for Performing Set
       Operations on Polygonal Regions in the Plane" which the original
       code did not do. I also modified it for integer coordinates
       and faster computation. The license for this modified copy was
       switched to the GPL per term (3) of the original LGPL license.
