librnd was moved out from pcb-rnd in 2020.
pcb-rnd started as a fork of gEDA/PCB. A brief history of PCB:
 PCB was originally written by Thomas Nau
 Development was later taken over by harry eaton
 The port to GTK was done by Bill Wilson
 Dan McMahill converted the build system from imake to autoconf/automake.
 DJ Delorie wrote the trace optimizer, added symbolic flag support and
 many other improvements.
