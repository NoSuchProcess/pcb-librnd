librnd 3.2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major API extension release for supporting sch-rnd. New API includes:
 - extensions to the pane widget so positions can be saved/restored
 - conf and DAD upgrades for supporting multiple designs in parallel
 - DAD support for small progress bar
 - import the generic part of pixmap, ps and svg plugins (both import
   and export) from pcb-rnd so other ringdove apps can reuse them
