librnd 3.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the first release of librnd that is not synchronized with pcb-rnd.
As part of becoming a true stand-alone library, 3.0.0 features
a large scale API change/upgrade that makes it incompatible with earlier
versions.

Other than the major version change and all the build system and API
upgrades required for the final split from pcb-rnd, this release
doesn't contain any major new feature.
