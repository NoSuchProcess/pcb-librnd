librnd 3.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~

3.1.1 implements hid_gtk4_gl, which is a fully working GUI HID with
gtk4.4 or newer, using VAO based opengl rendering. The new HID does not
change library API so it does not warrant a new minor version number.
All applications using librnd can automatically use gtk4 now (even
without the app recompiled).

Besides the new opengl and gtk4 code and related refactoring of gtk and
gl plugins, this release also features a lot of minor bugfixes.
