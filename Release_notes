librnd 4.3.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minor bugfix release with strong focus on polybool2. Notable changes:

- Polybool2: important bugfixes; implement selectable rule (non-zero or
  even-odd)

- Polybool2: start decoupling the code from librnd-core so it can be moved
  out to a stand-alone poly clipping library later

- Improve "floating-fhs" mode (when sch-rnd is installed in an FHS-compatible
  directory tree but not under root of the file system but in /opt or
  /home/user or /tmp or anywhere else)
