librnd 2.3.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mainly a bugfix release. There are two major new features:

1. Simpler plugin conf loading from the user dir: load *.conf, plugins
   don't need to register specific file names.

2. Anyload: load menu patches, config files, and whatever resource files
   plugins may register through an unified interface (CLI and GUI).
