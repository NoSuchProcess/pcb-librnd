<table border=1 cellspacing=0>
	<tr><th> &lt;app-specific-tool-name&gt;
	<td> Select the indicated tool. Tool names depend on the application and
	     plugins loaded. For example in pcb-rnd one of the valid tool names
	     is <b>Line</b>.

	<tr><th> Press
	<td> Called when you press the mouse button, or move the mouse.

	<tr><th> Release
	<td> Called when you release the mouse button.

	<tr><th> Cancel
	<td> Cancels any pending tool activity, allowing you to restart elsewhere.
	     For example, this allows you to start a new line rather than attach a
	     line to the previous line.

	<tr><th> Escape
	<td> Similar to Cancel but calling this action a second time will return
	     to the Arrow tool.

	<tr><th> Stroke
	<td> If librnd was built with libstroke, this invokes the stroke
	     input method.  If not, this will restart a drawing mode if you were
	     drawing, else it will select objects.

	<tr><th> Save
	<td> Remembers the current tool.

	<tr><th> Restore
	<td> Restores the tool to the last saved tool.
