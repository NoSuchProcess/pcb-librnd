*** Upcoming release ***
- 3.2.0: ABI compatible, API extensions
	- new export libs: add some way to configure behavior (e.g. not exporting pixmaps)
	- check how pcb-rnd's export_lpr could be centralized
	- CLEANUP/BUG: revise rnd_dad_tree_modify_cell() - previous cell[] should be free'd...
	- cleanup: add new pre/post callbacks in rnd_conf_hid_callbacks_t with hidlib passed
	- beside window positions, also remember paned ratios (reported with fsd); needs named paneds on DAD, maybe more generic RND_DAD_SET_ID? [report: Wojciech]
	- move pcb-rnd dialogs/dlg_undo and sch-rnd's sch_dialogs/dlg_undo to librnd, rename action to UndoHistory but keep an UndoDialog wrapper in pcb-rnd for compatibility
	- cleanup: add /local/librnd/* copies of /local/pcb/* scconfig vars (mark /local/pcb obsolete)
	- BUG: use libualloc for rtree stack instead of static allocation [report: Vuokko]

*** Later releases ***

- 4.0.0: ABI incompatible (feature removal)
	- hidlib_init1() should rnd_conf_set() "rc/path/exec_prefix" at the end so the host app doesn't need to
	- bug_files/TODO/L4.patch: -I include/librnd4/librnd and changing installation path to avoid collision with librnd3; also requires apps to change -I
	- *FEATURE: sch-rnd critical: hid->draw_pixmap should pass the original object as void, so that the high level export plugin can embed hints in the output (e.g. sch-rnd embedding text to make the drawing searchable)
	- BUG: camv-rnd old dep workaround: remove trunk/src/Makefile.in TODO#GENHT part and test with system installed fungw+genht and camv-rnd
	- *BUG: sch-rnd critical: in the installed .mak LIBRND_LIBDIR shall include /librnd4 suffix, librnd's scconfig templates depend on this! (sch-rnd has scconfig template dups because of this)
	- *BUG: sch-rnd critical: hid export API doesn't pass hidlib when needed
	- cleanup: remove old callbacks in rnd_conf_hid_callbacks_t without hidlib passing
	- cleanup: rnd_pref_tab_hook_s calls need hidlib arg: open_cb, board_changed_cb, meta_changed_cb
	- feature: rnd_pref_tab_hook_s ->open should deliver extra action arguments because some tabs may have optional args to specify how exactly it should be open
	- move rnd_gtk_conf_hid.plugins.hid_gtk.global_grid.sparse and "local grid" from gtk to global config,make sure all HIDs do it
	- remove /local/pcb/* scconfig vars
	- remove rnd_hid_cfg_keys_input_() and rnd_hid_cfg_keys_input(), rename rnd_hid_cfg_keys_input2_() and rnd_hid_cfg_keys_input2()
	- remove code marked with REMOVE_4.0.0
	- rename RND_EVENT_BOARD_CHANGED to _REPLACED
	- rename events RND_EVENT_BOARD_* to RND_EVENT_DESIGN_*
	- rename textual event names from pcbev_* in event.c
	- move RND_HATT_SUBDIALOG within the enum to under RND_HATT_TEXT
	- rnd_app_t spares: conf_ignore lists (two void *)
	- remove unused flags from rnd_hid_fsd_flags_t
		- remove RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE
		- remove RND_HID_FSD_MAY_NOT_EXIST and RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE (replace them with 0 in code)
	- remove rnd_hid_t->fileselect (code should use rnd_hid_fileselect() instead, which should call lib_hid_common's fileselect through a global pointer hook, plug_ style)
	- remove rnd_hid_t->heavy_term_layer_ind and figure how to substitute it in a portable way
	- remove rnd_hid_t->set_draw_faded and figure how to substitute
	- make HID_SC_ an enum
	- remove rnd_hid_t->point_cusror in favor of rnd_hid_t->set_mouse_cursor
	- check what's the diff between rnd_hid_t-> user_context and hid_data; maybe it is enough to keep only one
	- there are no spare fields in:
		- rnd_hid_tree_t (calloced from macro so calloc is on app side!)
		- rnd_hid_dad_subdialog_s
	- simplify menu code, remove unused features:
		- core: RND_MF_ACTIVE, RND_MF_BACKGROUND, RND_MF_FOREGROUND, RND_MF_FONT
		- check in all HIDs as well

*** Unsorted ***
	- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
	- DAD: on fsd dir change filelist scroll state is not reset [report: Wojciech]
