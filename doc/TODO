- 3.1.0
	+ BUG: libarchdir is not written in the .mak file so camv-rnd has to guess (it is required for figuring sccbox and cquote) [report: Alain]
	- BUG: gtk4: resize main window bigger: left pane gets exrta pixels; should respect expfill [report: Erich]
	- BUG: gtk4: layer prorperties; left pane is too small [report: Erich]

- 3.1.1
	- remove gtk2 grip handle widget (dlg_topwin_grip.c)
	- both gtk2 and gtk4 as plugins (build system): remove gtkx cflags, use separate gtk2 and gtk4 cflags else lib_gtk4_common is compiled with gtk2 flags!
	- gtk4 opengl:
		- top window drawign: scroll wheel zoom
		- top window drawign: scroll wheel pan with shift and ctrl
		- preview window drawign: scroll wheel zoom
		- preview window drawign: scroll wheel pan with shift and ctrl
		- pointer warp on X11 (ui_crosshair.c)
		- benchmark

- 4.0.0:
	- rename RND_EVENT_BOARD_CHANGED to _REPLACED
	- rename events RND_EVENT_BOARD_* to RND_EVENT_DESIGN_*
	- rename textual event names from pcbev_* in event.c
	- move RND_HATT_SUBDIALOG within the enum to under RND_HATT_TEXT
	- rnd_app_t spares: conf_ignore lists (two void *)
	- remove RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE
	- remove rnd_hid_t->fileselect (code should use rnd_hid_fileselect() instead, which should call lib_hid_common's fileselect through a global pointer hook, plug_ style)
	- remove rnd_hid_t->heavy_term_layer_ind and figure how to substitute it in a portable way
	- remove rnd_hid_t->set_draw_faded and figure how to substitute
	- remove RND_HID_FSD_MAY_NOT_EXIST and RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE (replace them with 0 in code)
	- make HID_SC_ an enum
	- remove rnd_hid_t->point_cusror in favor of rnd_hid_t->set_mouse_cursor
	- check what's the diff between rnd_hid_t-> user_context and hid_data; maybe it is enough to keep only one
	- there are no spare fields in:
		- rnd_hid_tree_t (calloced from macro so calloc is on app side!)
		- rnd_hid_dad_subdialog_s
	- remove unused flags from rnd_hid_fsd_flags_t
	- simplify menu code, remove unused features:
		- core: RND_MF_ACTIVE, RND_MF_BACKGROUND, RND_MF_FOREGROUND, RND_MF_FONT
		- check in all HIDs as well

unsorted:
	- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
	- beside window positions, also remember paned ratios (reported with fsd) [report: Wojciech]
	- DAD: on fsd dir change filelist scroll state is not reset [report: Wojciech]
