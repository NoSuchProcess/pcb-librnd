1. For the upcoming release ===============================================================================
	- polybool:
		- rnd_polyarea_and_subtract_free() should call the postprocessor
		- bf fails on OSX (repro can reproduce it): infinite loop? happens only with -O3
		- finish self intersecting holes: sih_*
		- olap_spiral: buggy input not detected
	? BUG: font2: load-save aussiefont v3 r1416: coordinates of $ atoms change [report: Erich]
	- FEATURE: font v2: upgrade aussiefont:
		- step #1: make sure drawing atom andd glyph advance are round mil numbers (use >=1 mil grid)
		- step #2: make sure the default advance value is consistent and renders correctly; test string: || and ii (this depends on atom thickness too)
		- step #3: make sure tab is thin and space has the proper advance
		- step #4: set and verify tab_width; rule of thumb: should be about 4 'M' width, rounded up to 10mil
		- step #5: set and verify baseline
		- step #6: kerning tables
		- step #7: entities: some from the greek alphabet, <sup> numbers (10) and degree sign all in upper 127
		- step #8: line_height; test with first line with descend chars like jjjj, second line with tall ascend chars like @@@@; rule of thumb: there should be about 1/10th of "max_height" free space between lines

2. For later releases ===============================================================================
	- implement pixmap export: bitmap object export in png, ps, eps, svg (for osm-rnd)
	- BUG: shift+arrow key in act_Cursor() does strante things both in pcb-rnd and sch-rnd [report: Vuokko]
	- BUG: perma scripts are initialized too late
		- sch-rnd postproc scripts won't run when invoked with ./sch-rnd a.rs
		- plugins are all loaded and initialied but permascripts are loaded only in interactive main loop
		- can't easily change this without breaking existing scripts that depend on GUI availability
		- can add a new flag in scripts.lht to load a script earlier
			- "earlier" should be a new event probably, that runs after loading all plugins and doing all initialization but before loading anything
			- check if we have GUI for editing permascript; if so, add this there too
		- sch-rnd doc: trunk/doc/user/07_io/alien/index.html: look for <!--TODO#1--> and update it (from which version of librnd it works and how)

3. Long term ===============================================================================
	- API deletion (5.0.0)
		- DAD close buttons can't have tooltips (for sch-rnd)
			- need to add an optional tooltip field at the _end_ of rnd_hid_dad_buttons_t
			- need to add spares in rnd_hid_dad_buttons_t
		- DAD: add spares in rnd_dad_retovr_t
		- CLEANUP/BUG: remove -Dinline= from scconfig/, it breaks on mac: configure camv-rnd without --debug, it will yield multiple symbols in link (itwas for old versions of genht vs. c89)
			- see bug_files/TODO/inline.patch
			- requires API change because apps depend on -Dinline too
			- remove --debug on mac from INSTALL and mac.txt
		- lib_exp_text/draw_svg.h: add colorspace in init()
		- remove old font support
			- remove xform compatibility .h from font, it's been moved to core
			- maybe remove the whole old font/
			- remove font2 rnd_font_fix_v1() - used by sch-rnd with font v1
			- remove font2 rnd_font_draw_string_justify() - used by sch-rnd with font v1
		- add spares to rnd_conf.h main structs else it's impossible to add new conf items
		- spare write back:
			- rnd_app_t in hidlib.h
			- attr_dlg_widget_focus in hid.h
			- widget_focus in rnd_hid_compound_t in hid_dad.h
			- coord_per_pix in rnd_hid_expose_ctx_s in hid.h
			- rnd_hid_tree_t in hid_dad.h: hid_get_selected_multi_cb()
			- lib_exp_text/draw_svg.h: rnd_svg_t
			- lib_exp_text/draw_ps.h: rnd_ps_t
			- lib_exp_text/draw_eps.h: rnd_eps_t
			- lib_exp_pixmap/draw_pixmap.h: rnd_drwpx_t
		- osm-rnd: TODO#fy5: we seem to have the wrong y values in gtk top window viewbox when flip_y==1
	- script bindings for creating new conf nodes [report: Majenko]
		- probably needs a new subtree next to plugins/
		- remove all nodes registered on script unload
		- what if two scripts try to register the same path?

4. Low prio ===============================================================================
	- BUG: use libualloc for rtree stack instead of static allocation [report: Vuokko]
	- lesstif (would be removed anyway)
		- BUG: hid_lesstif potential bug: bug_files/TODO/lesstif.txt [report: Fuz]
		- multi preview widget: implement gtk's r34242, r34773
		- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
		- implement gtk's tree view multi select API
