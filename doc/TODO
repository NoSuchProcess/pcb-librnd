- 3.0.2
	- fsd:
		- subdialog
			- lesstif implementation
			- poke callback in fsd code
		- gtk tree bug:
			- open fsd, click into the file list, press pg down many times -> crash or dialog close (valgrind?)
			- tree scroll bug when using the keyboard
	- BUG: lesstif: popup on pcb-rnd padstack fails: rnd_hid_get_coords() doesn't remember last coord (called from dlg_padstacks.c pcb_act_PadstackEdit() F_Object branch)
- 3.1.0
	- publish RND_DAD_SUBDIALOG (from lib_hid_common/dlg_fileselect.c to hid_dad.h)
	- publish rnd_file_stat() in safe_fs.h
	- install gensexpr headers (3rd) - check if all other 3rd are installed
	- gensexpr (under lib_gesexpr) got a new config bit; enable that pcb-rnd plugins/io_dsn (look for the TODO there)
	- BUG: libarchdir is not written in the .mak file so camv-rnd has to guess (it is required for figuring sccbox and cquote) [report: Alain]
	- pcb-rnd: enable io_altium if librnd 3.1.0 is available (sphash -i is required)
	- add rnd_hid_fileselect() in hid.h
- 4.0.0:
	- move RND_HATT_SUBDIALOG within the enum to under RND_HATT_TEXT
	- rnd_app_t spares: conf_ignore lists (two void *)
	- remove RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE
	- remove rnd_hid_t->fileselect (code should use rnd_hid_fileselect() instead)
	- remove rnd_hid_t->heavy_term_layer_ind and figure how to substitute it in a portable way
	- remove rnd_hid_t->set_draw_faded and figure how to substitute
	- make HID_SC_ an enum
	- remove rnd_hid_t->point_cusror in favor of rnd_hid_t->set_mouse_cursor
	- check what's the diff between rnd_hid_t-> user_context and hid_data; maybe it is enough to keep only one
	- there are no spare fields in:
		- rnd_hid_tree_t (calloced from macro so calloc is on app side!)
		- rnd_hid_dad_subdialog_s

unsorted:
	- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
	- beside window positions, also remember paned ratios (reported with fsd) [report: Wojciech]
	- DAD: on fsd dir change filelist scroll state is not reset [report: Wojciech]
