- 3.1.1: ABI compatible, no extensions
	- BUG: hidgl.c doesn't implement sparse grid; also check lesstif [report: Igor2]
	- BUG: right click context menu on mask layer, insert new layer after current, finish the dialog -> GUI lockup
	- gtk4 opengl rendering:
		- xor draw does not work
		- layer alpha: 0.88 in gtk4 looks lik 0.75 in gtk2
		- implement prim based colors or vertex based colors
		- preview rendering doesn't work
	- gtk4 test afteropengl:
		- top window drawign: scroll wheel zoom
		- top window drawign: scroll wheel pan with shift and ctrl
		- preview window drawign: scroll wheel zoom
		- preview window drawign: scroll wheel pan with shift and ctrl
		- pointer warp on X11 (ui_crosshair.c)
		- benchmark

- 3.2.0: ABI compatible, API extensions
	- beside window positions, also remember paned ratios (reported with fsd); needs named paneds on DAD, maybe more generic RND_DAD_SET_ID? [report: Wojciech]

- 4.0.0: ABI incompatible (feature removal)
	- rename RND_EVENT_BOARD_CHANGED to _REPLACED
	- rename events RND_EVENT_BOARD_* to RND_EVENT_DESIGN_*
	- rename textual event names from pcbev_* in event.c
	- move RND_HATT_SUBDIALOG within the enum to under RND_HATT_TEXT
	- rnd_app_t spares: conf_ignore lists (two void *)
	- remove unused flags from rnd_hid_fsd_flags_t
		- remove RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE
		- remove RND_HID_FSD_MAY_NOT_EXIST and RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE (replace them with 0 in code)
	- remove rnd_hid_t->fileselect (code should use rnd_hid_fileselect() instead, which should call lib_hid_common's fileselect through a global pointer hook, plug_ style)
	- remove rnd_hid_t->heavy_term_layer_ind and figure how to substitute it in a portable way
	- remove rnd_hid_t->set_draw_faded and figure how to substitute
	- make HID_SC_ an enum
	- remove rnd_hid_t->point_cusror in favor of rnd_hid_t->set_mouse_cursor
	- check what's the diff between rnd_hid_t-> user_context and hid_data; maybe it is enough to keep only one
	- there are no spare fields in:
		- rnd_hid_tree_t (calloced from macro so calloc is on app side!)
		- rnd_hid_dad_subdialog_s
	- simplify menu code, remove unused features:
		- core: RND_MF_ACTIVE, RND_MF_BACKGROUND, RND_MF_FOREGROUND, RND_MF_FONT
		- check in all HIDs as well

unsorted:
	- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
	- DAD: on fsd dir change filelist scroll state is not reset [report: Wojciech]
