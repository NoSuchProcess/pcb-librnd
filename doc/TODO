1. For the upcoming release ===============================================================================
- BUG: libualloc *_api.h are not installed
+ BUG: make sure tests compile with -DNDEBUG in production, else it fails in alpine packaging (-fomit-frame-pointer brings in fortify headers for some reason which fail with use-librnd #defines in config.h) [report: aron]
- 4.0.0: ABI incompatible (feature removal)
	- HID API for mbtk: pixmaps require a one-time registration and an unique ID
		- check how pcb-rnd layersel would work with this
		- canvas:
			- opengl clipping: hidgl_expose_init() may need am x,y origin; glscissor may conflict with stencil?
	- CLEANUP/BUG: revise rnd_dad_tree_modify_cell() - previous cell[] should be free'd...
		- apply librnd core patch TODO.hid_dad_tree
		- make sure all callers strdup() all cells
		- user implemented ->user_free_cb() should never free cell values, the lib does that
	- move rnd_gtk_conf_hid.plugins.hid_gtk.global_grid.sparse and "local grid" from gtk to global config,make sure all HIDs do it
	- scconfig: remove /local/pcb/ from templates and hooks.c on librnd side
		- remove /local/pcb from librnd central scconfig
		- for plugin control rename /local/pcb to /local/plugin/
		- search for TODO:pcb1 in *: replace with /local/rnd/ (and make sure in librnd we also set /local/rnd/ for these few, besides /local/librnd)
		- switch over librnd published templates, see TODO.template
			- use /local/mod/ for module temps instead of /local/pcb/mod
			- use /local/plugin for plugin states, like /local/pcb/hid_batch
	- multi design (multides.html):
		- config handling
			- if a shared tree (project, user, sys) changes, we need to re-merge all design's rnd_conf_fields
				- call conf change callback on every design affected
			- valgrind: sch-rnd -x single sheet then batch HID multiple sheets quit: make sure all configs are free'd
			- BUG: sch-rnd: start with 2 sheets, select wire tool on one, switch to the other -> tool state not reset
			- BUG: sch-rnd: start with A.rs and B.rs from CLI, load C.rs from GUI: switch with {<} and {>}, sheetsel lags behind (GUI load is probably not needed)
			- pcb-rnd, camv-rnd: switch over to rnd_conf_plug_(un)reg()
		- implement every little detail of the new project file handling as specified
		- once multi is implemented: rnd_mainloop_interactive() shouldn't receiver a hidlib arg (assume it's already set in the gui earlier in main); check if happens in camv-rnd as well (it's single-design)
		- export API for exporting a whole project at once (instead of exporting a single sheet); pass on project ptr, not sheet ptr
	- DAD API: think over and document if ->set_val() hv.str needs to be strdupped; probably best if the lib strdups it (revise callers)
	- grep for "multi:" or TODO.*multi in sch-rnd
	- grep the code for 4.0.0 for more (don't remove this until all items resolved as more 4.0.0 may be added)

2. For later releases ===============================================================================

3. Long term ===============================================================================

4. Low prio ===============================================================================
	- BUG: use libualloc for rtree stack instead of static allocation [report: Vuokko]
	- lesstif (would be removed anyway)
		- BUG: hid_lesstif potential bug: bug_files/TODO/lesstif.txt [report: Fuz]
		- multi preview widget: implement gtk's r34242, r34773
		- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
	- bitmap object export in png, ps, eps, svg
	- FEATURE: font -v2 support:
		- baseline?
		- optional kerning table: a single dx value for combiation of 2 glyphs; second glyph usually needs to moved in the negative direction
		- save and load ->height, check calls to rnd_font_fix_v1() and don't call it if ->height is loaded
		- unicode translation table so that the upper 127 chars can be used for mu, degree and similar
