1. For the upcoming release ===============================================================================
	- polybool:
		- BUG: work/poly/tester/tests/TODO/selfi1/: two islands of polygon A (red) causes self intersection
			-> this confuses the algo later because poly B intersects too much
			-> cheap cross-check: subtract 1 from the x coords of the triangle in A, so self intersection doesn't happen
	- fsd: pcb-rnd: save as, enter a new file name, click 'ok' -> gtk errors on stderr (doesn't happen on enter) [report: Igor2]
	- FEATURE: font v2: upgrade aussiefont:
		- entities: some from the greek alphabet, <sup> numbers (10) and degree sign all in upper 127
		- kerning
		- tab_width
		- baseline
		- line_height

2. For later releases ===============================================================================
	- BUG: perma scripts are initialized too late
		- sch-rnd postproc scripts won't run when invoked with ./sch-rnd a.rs
		- plugins are all loaded and initialied but permascripts are loaded only in interactive main loop
		- can't easily change this without breaking existing scripts that depend on GUI availability
		- can add a new flag in scripts.lht to load a script earlier
			- "earlier" should be a new event probably, that runs after loading all plugins and doing all initialization but before loading anything
			- check if we have GUI for editing permascript; if so, add this there too
		- sch-rnd doc: trunk/doc/user/07_io/alien/index.html: look for <!--TODO#1--> and update it (from which version of librnd it works and how)

3. Long term ===============================================================================
	- API deletion (5.0.0)
		- CLEANUP/BUG: remove -Dinline= from scconfig/, it breaks on mac: configure camv-rnd without --debug, it will yield multiple symbols in link (itwas for old versions of genht vs. c89)
			- see bug_files/TODO/inline.patch
			- requires API change because apps depend on -Dinline too
			- remove --debug on mac from INSTALL and mac.txt
		- remove old font support
			- remove xform compatibility .h from font, it's been moved to core
			- maybe remove the whole old font/
			- remove font2 rnd_font_fix_v1() - used by sch-rnd with font v1
			- remove font2 rnd_font_draw_string_justify() - used by sch-rnd with font v1
		- spare write back:
			- rnd_app_t in hidlib.h
			- attr_dlg_widget_focus in hid.h
			- widget_focus in rnd_hid_compound_t in hid_dad.h
			- coord_per_pix in rnd_hid_expose_ctx_s in hid.h
			- rnd_hid_tree_t in hid_dad.h: hid_get_selected_multi_cb()
	- script bindings for creating new conf nodes [report: Majenko]
		- probably needs a new subtree next to plugins/
		- remove all nodes registered on script unload
		- what if two scripts try to register the same path?

4. Low prio ===============================================================================
	- BUG: use libualloc for rtree stack instead of static allocation [report: Vuokko]
	- lesstif (would be removed anyway)
		- BUG: hid_lesstif potential bug: bug_files/TODO/lesstif.txt [report: Fuz]
		- multi preview widget: implement gtk's r34242, r34773
		- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
		- implement gtk's tree view multi select API
	- bitmap object export in png, ps, eps, svg
