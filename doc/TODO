1. For the upcoming release ===============================================================================
- 4.0.0: ABI incompatible (feature removal)
	- HID API for mbtk: pixmaps require a one-time registration and an unique ID
		- check how pcb-rnd layersel would work with this
		- canvas:
			- opengl clipping: hidgl_expose_init() may need am x,y origin; glscissor may conflict with stencil?
	- move rnd_gtk_conf_hid.plugins.hid_gtk.global_grid.sparse and "local grid" from gtk to global config,make sure all HIDs do it
	- BUG: sch-rnd multi: start sch-rnd with a file name to a non-existing project: sheetsel is confused
	- BUG: sch-rnd multi: start sch-rnd with 2 file names to a non-existing project: only one is created
	- BUG: sch-rnd multi: start sch-rnd with a sheet name; open a second from gui; unload either; the other will go black background (probably conf messup)
	- BUG: sch-rnd ran with valgrind on gtk2+gdk; library window, select something to place: xor drawn is blinking on selection - maybe loaded or drawn multiple times?
	- grep for "multi:" or TODO.*multi in sch-rnd
	- grep sch-rnd for librnd4 for more (don't remove this until all items resolved as more 4.0.0 may be added)

2. For later releases ===============================================================================

3. Long term ===============================================================================

4. Low prio ===============================================================================
	- BUG: use libualloc for rtree stack instead of static allocation [report: Vuokko]
	- lesstif (would be removed anyway)
		- BUG: hid_lesstif potential bug: bug_files/TODO/lesstif.txt [report: Fuz]
		- multi preview widget: implement gtk's r34242, r34773
		- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
	- bitmap object export in png, ps, eps, svg
	- FEATURE: font -v2 support:
		- baseline?
		- optional kerning table: a single dx value for combiation of 2 glyphs; second glyph usually needs to moved in the negative direction
		- save and load ->height, check calls to rnd_font_fix_v1() and don't call it if ->height is loaded
		- unicode translation table so that the upper 127 chars can be used for mu, degree and similar
