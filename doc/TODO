- 3.1.0
	- pcb-rnd: TODO#72: don't scroll the box when the tree is scrolled
	- install gensexpr headers (3rd) - check if all other 3rd are installed
	- gensexpr (under lib_gesexpr) got a new config bit; enable that pcb-rnd plugins/io_dsn (look for the TODO there)
	- BUG: libarchdir is not written in the .mak file so camv-rnd has to guess (it is required for figuring sccbox and cquote) [report: Alain]
	- pcb-rnd: enable io_altium if librnd 3.1.0 is available (sphash -i is required)
	- move preferences
		- pcb_board_set_changed_flag() is called from dlg_pref_confedit.c; change this into an event from librnd
	- move diag/rnd_diag
- 4.0.0:
	- move RND_HATT_SUBDIALOG within the enum to under RND_HATT_TEXT
	- rnd_app_t spares: conf_ignore lists (two void *)
	- remove RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE
	- remove rnd_hid_t->fileselect (code should use rnd_hid_fileselect() instead, which should call lib_hid_common's fileselect through a global pointer hook, plug_ style)
	- remove rnd_hid_t->heavy_term_layer_ind and figure how to substitute it in a portable way
	- remove rnd_hid_t->set_draw_faded and figure how to substitute
	- remove RND_HID_FSD_MAY_NOT_EXIST and RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE (replace them with 0 in code)
	- make HID_SC_ an enum
	- remove rnd_hid_t->point_cusror in favor of rnd_hid_t->set_mouse_cursor
	- check what's the diff between rnd_hid_t-> user_context and hid_data; maybe it is enough to keep only one
	- there are no spare fields in:
		- rnd_hid_tree_t (calloced from macro so calloc is on app side!)
		- rnd_hid_dad_subdialog_s
	- remove unused flags from rnd_hid_fsd_flags_t

unsorted:
	- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
	- beside window positions, also remember paned ratios (reported with fsd) [report: Wojciech]
	- DAD: on fsd dir change filelist scroll state is not reset [report: Wojciech]
