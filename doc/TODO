1. For the upcoming release ===============================================================================
	- BUG: pick up packaging diffs from Bdale's 4.0.0 upload

2. For later releases ===============================================================================
	- API additions (4.1.0)
		- move sch-rnd's libcschem/util_path to librnd; pcb-rnd has something similar too
		- move sch-rnd's basename() call next to dirname()
		- FEATURE: font -v2 support:
			- prepare for the new font lib
				- move camv-rnd's mx_extract_*() to the font xform lib
				- move the font xform lib to core, keep a .h at the font #including the new .h for compatibility
				- copy font to font2
				- add spares
			- font upgrade:
				- test-parse call or some other way to avoid font load error on valid lihata fonts
				- baseline?
				- optional kerning table: a single dx value for combiation of 2 glyphs; second glyph usually needs to moved in the negative direction
				- save and load ->height, check calls to rnd_font_fix_v1() and don't call it if ->height is loaded
				- unicode translation table so that the upper 127 and lower 32 chars can be used for mu, degree and similar
					- custom &name; -> integer translation table
					- as a convention &amp; should be added to point to &
					- new text flag in sch-rnd and pcb-rnd (similar to dyntext) that activates translation
					- GUI text edit could auto-replace unicode with &unicode_name;
					- upgrade aussiefont: greek alphabet (2*24), <sup> numbers (10) and degree sign all in upper 127
	- CLEANUP/BUG: remove -Dinline= from scconfig/, it breaks on mac: configure camv-rnd without --debug, it will yield multiple symbols in link (itwas for old versions of genht vs. c89)
	- BUG: perma scripts are initialized too late
		- sch-rnd postporc scripts wont' run when invoked with ./sch-rnd a.rs
		- plugins are all loaded and initialied but permascripts are loaded only in interactive main loop
		- can't easily change this without breaking existing scripts that depend on GUI availability
		- can add a new flag in scripts.lht to load a script earlier
			- "earlier" should be a new event probably, that runs after loading all plugins and doing all initialization but before loading anything
			- check if we have GUI for editing permascript; if so, add this there too
		- sch-rnd doc: trunk/doc/user/07_io/alien/index.html: look for <!--TODO#1--> and update it (from which version of librnd it works and how)

3. Long term ===============================================================================
	- API deletion (5.0.0)
		- remove old font support
			- remove xform compatibility .h from font, it's been moved to core

4. Low prio ===============================================================================
	- BUG: use libualloc for rtree stack instead of static allocation [report: Vuokko]
	- lesstif (would be removed anyway)
		- BUG: hid_lesstif potential bug: bug_files/TODO/lesstif.txt [report: Fuz]
		- multi preview widget: implement gtk's r34242, r34773
		- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
	- bitmap object export in png, ps, eps, svg
