*** Upcoming release ***
- 3.2.0: ABI compatible, API extensions
	+ beside window positions, also remember paned ratios (reported with fsd) [report: Wojciech]
	- BUG: use libualloc for rtree stack instead of static allocation [report: Vuokko]

*** Later releases ***

- 4.0.0: ABI incompatible (feature removal)
	- CLEANUP/BUG: revise rnd_dad_tree_modify_cell() - previous cell[] should be free'd...
		- apply librnd core patch TODO.hid_dad_tree
		- make sure all callers strdup() all cells
		- user implemented ->user_free_cb() should never free cell values, the lib does that
	- hidlib_init1() should rnd_conf_set() "rc/path/exec_prefix" at the end so the host app doesn't need to
	- bug_files/TODO/L4.patch: -I include/librnd4/librnd and changing installation path to avoid collision with librnd3; also requires apps to change -I
	- *FEATURE: sch-rnd critical: hid->draw_pixmap should pass the original object as void, so that the high level export plugin can embed hints in the output (e.g. sch-rnd embedding text to make the drawing searchable)
	- BUG: camv-rnd old dep workaround: remove trunk/src/Makefile.in TODO#GENHT part and test with system installed fungw+genht and camv-rnd
	- *BUG: sch-rnd critical: in the installed .mak LIBRND_LIBDIR shall include /librnd4 suffix, librnd's scconfig templates depend on this! (sch-rnd has scconfig template dups because of this)
	- *BUG: sch-rnd critical: hid export API doesn't pass hidlib when needed
	- cleanup: rnd_pref_tab_hook_s calls need hidlib arg: open_cb, board_changed_cb, meta_changed_cb
	- feature: rnd_pref_tab_hook_s ->open should deliver extra action arguments because some tabs may have optional args to specify how exactly it should be open
	- move rnd_gtk_conf_hid.plugins.hid_gtk.global_grid.sparse and "local grid" from gtk to global config,make sure all HIDs do it
	- cleanup: remove separate RND_DAD_SET_PANE_NAME() and require every pane named in RND_DAD_BEGIN_[HV]PANE
	- remove /local/pcb/* scconfig vars
	- remove rnd_hid_cfg_keys_input_() and rnd_hid_cfg_keys_input(), rename rnd_hid_cfg_keys_input2_() and rnd_hid_cfg_keys_input2()
	- remove code marked with REMOVE_4.0.0
	- rename RND_EVENT_BOARD_CHANGED to _REPLACED
	- rename events RND_EVENT_BOARD_* to RND_EVENT_DESIGN_*
	- rename textual event names from pcbev_* in event.c
	- move RND_HATT_SUBDIALOG within the enum to under RND_HATT_TEXT
	- rnd_app_t spares: conf_ignore lists (two void *)
	- remove unused flags from rnd_hid_fsd_flags_t
		- remove RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE
		- remove RND_HID_FSD_MAY_NOT_EXIST and RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE (replace them with 0 in code)
	- remove rnd_hid_t->fileselect (code should use rnd_hid_fileselect() instead, which should call lib_hid_common's fileselect through a global pointer hook, plug_ style)
	- remove rnd_hid_t->heavy_term_layer_ind and figure how to substitute it in a portable way
	- remove rnd_hid_t->set_draw_faded and figure how to substitute
	- make HID_SC_ an enum
	- remove rnd_hid_t->point_cusror in favor of rnd_hid_t->set_mouse_cursor
	- check what's the diff between rnd_hid_t-> user_context and hid_data; maybe it is enough to keep only one
	- there are no spare fields in:
		- rnd_hid_tree_t (calloced from macro so calloc is on app side!)
		- rnd_hid_dad_subdialog_s
	- simplify menu code, remove unused features:
		- core: RND_MF_ACTIVE, RND_MF_BACKGROUND, RND_MF_FOREGROUND, RND_MF_FONT
		- check in all HIDs as well
	- scconfig: remove /local/pcb/ from templates and hooks.c on librnd side
		- remove /local/pcb from librnd central scconfig
		- for plugin control rename /local/pcb to /local/plugin/
		- search for TODO:pcb1 in *: replace with /local/rnd/ (and make sure in librnd we also set /local/rnd/ for these few, besides /local/librnd)
		- switch over librnd published templates, see TODO.template
			- use /local/mod/ for module temps instead of /local/pcb/mod
			- use /local/plugin for plugin states, like /local/pcb/hid_batch
	- multi design (multides.html):
		- event name cleanup: do not use BOARD to design (or to something better)
		- mark each event [local] or [global]
		- rename rnd_hidlib_t to rnd_design_t (or to something better)
		- cleanup: extned callbacks in rnd_conf_hid_callbacks_t to pass hidlib (multiple callbacks with different designs if multiple open designs are changed!)
		- rnd_hidlib_t must contain:
			- real file name (realpath'd)
			- original file name (short name, as the user called it)
		- switch over from rnd_conf and conf_core to per design conf
		- implement user file name and realpath file name
		- implement project list and pointing back
		- conf: implement a way to make sure design file list is coming from the project file only
		- implement every little detail of the new project file handling as specified
		- rnd_app.single_design setting for single design mode
		- make sure the batch HID maintains set/get_hidlib()

*** Unsorted ***
	- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
	- DAD: on fsd dir change filelist scroll state is not reset [report: Wojciech]
