- 3.0.2
	- BUG: lesstif: popup on pcb-rnd padstack fails: rnd_hid_get_coords() doesn't remember last coord (called from dlg_padstacks.c pcb_act_PadstackEdit() F_Object branch)
- 3.1.0
	- install gensexpr headers (3rd) - check if all other 3rd are installed
	- gensexpr (under lib_gesexpr) got a new config bit; enable that pcb-rnd plugins/io_dsn (look for the TODO there)
	- BUG: libarchdir is not written in the .mak file so camv-rnd has to guess (it is required for figuring sccbox and cquote) [report: Alain]
	- pcb-rnd: enable io_altium if librnd 3.1.0 is available (sphash -i is required)
- 4.0.0:
	- rnd_app_t spares: conf_ignore lists (two void *)
	- remove RND_HID_FSD_IS_TEMPLATE

unsorted:
	- lesstif: vertical text, truncated text support
