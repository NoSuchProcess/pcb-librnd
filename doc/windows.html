<h1> librnd on windows </h1>

<p>It should work on any windows version from 7 up. (It does _not_ work on XP.)

<p>Only cross compilaton from linux is supported. Because of unsolvable limitations,
of windows dlls, dynamic loaded plugins are not possible and every plugin
must be static linked.

<p>At the moment there is no separate librnd binary distribution to windows
as Ringdove application are cross-compiled into a single windows binaries pack.
