<h1> Limitations on various GUI backends </h1>

<h2> Wayland (with gtk4) </h2>

<p>
The mouse cursor can not be moved to a specific location on the screen
thus functionality where pcb-rnd would move the crosshair to a location
will not work.

<p>
Remembering window geometry won't work because there is no gtk API for
setting window size or position.
