<H1> fsd: file selection dialog </H1>
<p>
The fsd is used to present the file system and assist the user in selecting
an existing file for load or a directory and a file name for save. The
dialog consists of five main sections:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> top part (file name and directory buttons)
	<li> middle left (shortcuts)
	<li> middle right (file list)
	<li> bottom left (optional subdialog for extra options)
	<li> bottom right (cancel/ok)
</ul>
<p>

<p>
The dialog box has an important state: CWD (Current Working Directory). This
is the directory the dialog box is listing at the moment and does not affect
the CWD of the application. The user has multiple options to change the CWD
of the dialog box.
<p>
The <b>top part</b> features the <b>file name text input</b>. If a directory name is
entered here (either absolute or relative to current CWD), the dialog box
switches CWD to that directory. If a file name (either absolute or relative to
the current CWD) is entered and enter is pressed (or the ok button is clicked),
it is taken as the resulting file name and is returned and the dialog box is
closed.
<p>
Still in the <b>top part</b> A horizontally aligned set of <b>directory
buttons</b> follows. This displays the CWD. Each button represents a
directory in the absolute path to CWD. If the CWD is changed in any way
these buttons are updated. If CWD path is too deep, the central few
directories are substituted with "...", displaying only the first few and
last few buttons of the path. If any directory name on the path is longer
than configured (in plugins/lib_hid_common/fsd/dirname_maxlen), it's
truncated. When a directory button is clicked, the CWD is changed to that
directory.
<p>
The <b>middle left part</b> is a 2 level tree of shortcuts. First level entries
are:
<p>
<ul>
	<li> Filesystem: shows a few hardwired useful locations (system-specific).
	     Hosts directories.
	<li> Favorites (global): user configured favorite locations that are common
	     to all fsd dialogs within the application.
	     CWD can be added using the '+' button.
	     Hosts directories.
	<li> Favorites (local): user configured favorite locations that are specific
	     to the operation that opened the fsd dialog (e.g. save as).
	     CWD can be added using the '+' button.
	     Hosts directories.
	<li> Recent: the last few files successfully selected via the fsd dialog ran
	     for this specific operation (e.g. load). The length of this tree is
	     controlled by the plugins/lib_hid_common/fsd/recent_maxlines config
	     node. New entries are added on the bottom; when the list gets too long,
	     entries on the top are removed.
	     Hosts files.
</ul>
<p>
Double clicking(or selecting and pressing enter) on a directory will change
CWD to that directory. Double clicking(or selecting and pressing enter) on
a file will make that file the result of the dialog (closes the dialog).
Pressing the '+' button will add CWD to Favorites (local or global,
depending on where the cursor is in the shortcuts tree). Pressing the
'-' button while an entry is selected will remove the entry.
<p>
Favorites/recents are saved in plain text files upon any user input that
changes them. The files are kept in fsd/ under the application's dotdir,
e.g. ~/.pcb-rnd/fsd/ for pcb-rnd.
<p>
The <b>middle right part</b> is a flat list of files and directories found in
CWD. Size is in bytes, last modification date is in ISO 8601 (year-month-day).
<p>
Double clicking (or selecting and pressing enter) on a directory on this list
will change CWD to that directory. Double clicking (or selecting and
pressing enter) on a file on this list will close the dialog and return that
file as result of the fsd. While navigating this list (single click or
keyboard), the file name text input is updated with the file name the cursor
is on.
<p>
Under the file listing there is a row of widgets for sorting. The first
combo box decides by which column the list is sorted. If the checkbox for
"rev." is ticked, sort order is reversed. If the checkbox for "dir. grp." is
ticked, directories are grouped and separately from files. The default
valuye of "dir. grp." is determined by the config node
plugins/lib_hid_common/fsd/dir_grp.
<p>
The <b>bottom left part</b> optionally hosts a subdialog that is specific
for the operation the fsd is invoked for. It typically lists file format
and I/O options.
<p>
The <b>bottom right part</b> consists of the "cancel" and "ok" buttons. If
the "cancel" button is clicked, the dialog closes and returns "no file selected".
If the "ok" button is clicked the full path of the file entered in the
file name text input is returned as the result (and the dialog box is closed).
If the text input is empty, the 'ok' button is a no-op.
