If you are interested to help out, please

<H2> Contributing as a developer </h2>
<p>
The project is lead in an autocratic way by Igor2.
<p>
Developer freedom taken away:
<ul>
	<li> the basic concept of librnd is set and won't change
	<li> the toolchain is chosen, and won't change; the usual hot topics: svn, scconfig, <a href="developer/c89.html">C</a>.
	<li> don't add code that restricts usability for others; add code that increases usability for some; thus prefer to add code in plugins!
</ul>
<p>
Developer freedom promptly granted:
<ul>
	<li> svn commit access from day 0
	<li> work together in trunk/, not alone in a branch
	<li> librnd has a strong plugin support; want to implement a strange/controversial feature? In a plugin, almost anything goes
	<li> especially in plugins, work on whatever you want, even if noone else needs that feature
</ul>
<p>
Coding style/indentation: there's an <a href="developer/indent.html">unified style</a>
in core and core plugins. If you work on those parts, try to stick to it. If you
are working on a new plugin, it's still the preferred style but you can use
a different style. However, the rule is that if someone else starts hacking
that part too, he is allowed to convert the code to the unified format; but
unified format can not be converted to anything else. So it's a one way
process which long term grants unified style while not demotivates a plugin
developer by forcing a style on him in the early, "when the bulk of the code
is written" phase.
