<H1> The config system in librnd </H1>
<H2> Sources </H2>
There are different sources of configuration settings. These are
different configuration files, sometimes located on the file system.
The full list of config sources is:

<table border=1>
<tr><th> role     <th> default<br>setting<br>prio <th> location <th> presence <th> remarks
<tr><td> internal
    <td> 100
    <td> (compiled into the executable)
    <td> always
    <td> the ultimate fallback; allows the application to run even if no other configuration file is found


<tr><td> system
    <td> 200
    <td> app's conf in $(CONFDIR)
    <td> recommended
    <td> should hold system and installation specific settings, e.g. path to the system-wise installed footprint library

<tr><td> default board
    <td> 300
    <td> app's default design typically in /usr/share/APP/ <a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
    <td> deprecated<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
    <td> pcb editable defaults

<tr><td> user
    <td> 400
    <td> e.g. ~/.pcb-rnd/conf-core.lht
    <td> recommended
    <td> store user preferences, user's common footprint lib path, etc; this is the first file the user can modify (even from the GUI)

<tr><td> environment
    <td> 500
    <td> environment variables (TODO)
    <td> occasional
    <td> inject the same (temporary) settings in multiple app sessions without having to change config files

<tr><td> project
    <td> 600
    <td> project.lht in the project directory
    <td> optional
    <td> local project settings - useful for large projects with multiple board (.lht) files

<tr><td> design
    <td> 700
    <td> saved in the design (board, schematics, etc.)
    <td> optional, common
    <td> per design deviation from the user+system config

<tr><td> cli
    <td> 800
    <td> command line argument
    <td> occasional
    <td> inject/change a setting for a single session; useful in batch/automated processing
</table>

<p>
The application reads them all, then merges all settings into a master binary
representation. If a setting is specified in multiple sources, the one
with the higher priority wins, except for lists where it is also possible
to prepend/append items. Default priorities are designed to result
precedence in an intuitive way (e.g. design settings overwrite user settings).
However, <a href="prio.html">priority can be changed</a> per setting, resulting
in weak settings ("use this value if it was not already set") or strong settings
("I always want to use mincut, so I enable it from my user's config with high
priority and a version controlled project setting can not turn it off")

Footnotes:
<ul>
	<li id="footnote1"> <sup>1</sup>: in pcb-rnd the name of the default board is default4.lht for
	the default 4 layer board. The standard installation also ships default2.lht
	as a similar 2 layer board. The name of the default boardfile is configured
	in config node rc/default_pcb_file.
	<li id="footnote2"> <sup>2</sup>: default design should not contain a config subtree; it is
	easier to maintain the config tree if default configuration is coming from
	config files only.
</ul>
