<h1> librnnd font anatomy </h1>
<p>
Librnd is using a custom vector font originally derived from gEDA/PCB's
font concept. The rendering engine is custom and so is the terminology.
Below is a figure of a 2 line text object placed by baseline origin,
showing the names of different fields and concepts.
<p>

<p>
Each glyph is in a "cell" with its origin (0;0 coordinates) on the top
left. Cells have a font-global height but a per glyph width. Each glyph
also has an xdelta which is extra space left after the glyph on the right
side.
<p>
Optional baseline is specified from the top. Line height is the vertical
advance between two lines of text.
<p>
Note: strokes have their thickness (width); their coordinates are
specified centerline. That's why the vertical blue lines are crossing into
the rendered font: they hit the centerline of the glyph line atoms.

<h2> Coordinate values </h2>
<p>
The font is drawn in it's 1:1 scale (which is the 100% scale). All coordinate
values (sizes, widths, heights, thicknesses) are specified for this neutral
state. When the font is placed and scaled, everything scales linearly.
<p>
Classic stroke fonts are drawn using lines and arcs. Each line and each
arc has its own thickness, which is generally uniform in a font. Extra
decoraton, like serif, may use thinner lines/arcs. Bold version of a font
may use thicker lines/arcs.
<p>
Note: the host application may decide to override the original thickness
with a fixed value in which case all lines and arcs are rendered with the
same new thickness.
<p>
If the font uses polygons to specify the outline of glyphs, there is no
thickness: polygons have no contour thickness and the host application can
not override a value or change polygon dimensions.

<h2> kerning table </h2>
<p>
Normally the advance is calculated as width+xdelta. In the above example
from j's origin to E's origin it'ss j's width plus j's xdelta.
<p>
If j-E is present in the kerning table with a non-zero value, that
kerning value is also added to the above sum. A positive value will push E
to the right, a negative value to the left.

<h2> horizontal tabs </h2>
<p>
When enabled, horizontal tabs are renderedso they end at predefined
tab positions. The spacing between tabb positions is specified by
the font-global tab_width field.
