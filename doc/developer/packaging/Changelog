How to get a release candidate tarball in /tmp:

  ver=4.0.1
  cd /tmp
  svn export svn://repo.hu/librnd/trunk librnd-$ver
  tar -cf librnd-$ver.tar librnd-$ver

Packaging changes between 4.0.0 and 4.0.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. changes that probably don't need action

none

B. changes that probably DO need action

1. change in the main description: add gtk4 support (it's safe to advertise it)


Packaging changes between 4.0.0 and 3.2.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. changes that probably don't need action

1. Need conflict if librnd4-dev contains the .a libs. Normally we do
   not package the .a files with librnd4 because static linking is
   supported only in a very limited case. If you do package librnd*.a, it
   should happen in the -dev package and then librnd4-dev should conflict
   with librnd3-dev. So it is possible to install librnd4 and librnd3 binary
   packages in parallel but not the -dev packages. If your -dev package
   does not have the *.a files, even the -dev packages can be installed
   in parallel and no conflict is needed.


B. changes that probably DO need action

1. package renames for major version: all package names are prefixed with
   librnd4 instead of librnd3, so they can be installed in parallel.

2. the versionless .so files may require conflicts. Normally librnd3 and
   librnd4 can be installed in parallel because librnd4 files have different
   name. Normally in the -dev package there's librnd-hid.so symlink pointing
   to the "best version" of the .so, and this plain, versionless .so file name
   is the same as in any previous version. Normally apps from binary packages
   should link directly to a versioned .so, and this affects only those users
   who compile apps from source (thus the versionless .so symlink is
   typically in the -dev package). Normally your package manager should be
   able to handle doing this symlink automatically, but if it doesn't work
   out, you may need to add aconflict between librnd3-dev and librnd4-dev
   (but not between any other packages).

3. installed headers changed path from $PREFIX/include/librnd/* to
   $PREFIX/include/librnd4/librnd/* (this way .h files won't casue conflict
   between librnd3-dev and librnd4-dev)

4. wherever installation paths contained "librnd3", they contain "librnd4"
   now, i.e. $PREFIX/usr/lib/librnd4, $PREFIX/usr/share/librnd4

5. new *.so* files in the librnd4 package; we put all versioned non-plugin
   .so files ($PREFIX/lib/*.so.*) in the main binary package called librnd4;
   compared to librnd3 there's a new set of .so.* files there called
   librnd-core.so.*. The versionless librnd-core.so may go in the -dev package.
   If you already package .a files librnd-core.a needs to be packaged too.


Packaging changes between 3.2.2 and 3.2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. changes that probably don't need action

(none)

B. changes that probably DO need action

1. There's been a fix to make test, which should work reliably now. Please
   check if your build runs make test. If it doesn't, please make it run
   make test after make.


Packaging changes between 3.2.0 and 3.1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. changes that probably don't need action

(none)

B. changes that probably DO need action

1. new package: librnd-pixmap
   Contains plguins with new dependencies (libgd and its subpackages for
   png, jpeg and gif). Contains plugins import_pixmap_gd lib_exp_pixmap.

2. the ./configure line has changed accordingly


Packaging changes between 3.1.2 and 3.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. changes that probably don't need action

(none)

B. changes that probably DO need action

(none)

Packaging changes between 3.1.1 and 3.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. changes that probably don't need action

B. changes that probably DO need action

1. new plugin: librnd3-hid-gtk4-gl
   Requires gtk4 4.4.x. Does _not_ replace the gtk2 plugin, at the
   moment gtk4 is only an option.

2. system-installed fungw scripting is ready for packaging
   If your distribution has packages for fungw and genht, please add
   these two packages to librnd-dev deps and build-deps:
    - libgenht1-dev,
    - libfungw-dev


Packaging changes between 3.1.0 and 3.0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. changes that probably don't need action

1. plugin rename that do not affect pakcage names only installed file names:
   plugin lib_gtk_common to lib_gtk2_common in package librnd3-lib-gtk

B. changes that probably DO need action

1. new configure command line



Packaging changes between 3.0.2 and 3.0.1

none

B. changes that probably DO need action

none



Packaging changes between 3.0.1 and 3.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. changes that probably don't need action

1. note: there is no --confdir in the ./configure line, librnd does not
   install config files at the moment

2. note: please make sure librnd-dev installs sharedir/plugin.state
