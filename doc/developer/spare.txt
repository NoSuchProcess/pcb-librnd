To provide binary compatibility when adding new features, the following
precaution/mechanism is used in many of the public API structs:

1. The struct has a bunch of fields prefixed with spare_; these fields
   are of different type and are not used for anything in the current version

2. The user/caller, who allocates the structure, initializes all bytes of
   the structure to zero, including these spare fields. For the spare
   fields this is done implicitly, by zeroing the struct (by struct size),
   not by listing the spare fields. Most typical ways to do this are:
   - global variable (auto-initialized to 0)
   - local variable initialized to {0}
   - dynamically allocated memory via calloc()

3. If a new, _optional_ field is required in the struct, one of the
   spare field with matching type is renamed. The default, "called did not
   know/care about this field" value is 0. The size of the structure or
   the offset of any member do not change.

4. The rename happens in-place, so the new field is under the "spare fields"
   comment within the struct.

5. Any code dealing with the new field _must_ be prepared for value 0 and
   _must_ assume that may be due to an older app version that did not yet
   know about the field or feature associated with the field.

6. A TODO entry needs to be written about the struct->field under the group
   of entries for the next major version, in doc/TODO.

7. When breaking changes are introduced in the API, bumping the major version
   of the lib, all new fields created from spares should be moved out from the
   spare section and the spare field restored for reuse. (This does increase the
   size of the struct.)
